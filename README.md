# Electrocardiography (ECG) Project (Team work) 


---

## Overview

This project implements an Electrocardiography (ECG) system to record and monitor the electrical activity of the heart using electrodes placed on the limbs. The recorded signals are processed through instrumentation amplifiers and various filters to produce a clear ECG signal for analysis.

### Project Features:
- **Instrumentation Amplifier**: AD620 for high accuracy with CMRR of 100dB.
- **Filters**: High-pass, low-pass, and notch filters to eliminate noise and baseline wander.
- **Gain Stage**: Boosts weak signals generated by the heart.
- **Lead Selector**: Provides a 12-lead ECG system for comprehensive monitoring.
- **Driven-Right-Leg Circuit**: Reduces interference by canceling common-mode noise.
